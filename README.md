### Task :- Time series Forecasting 
#### Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

##### This project demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using the ARIMA model. The analysis is conducted on a dataset containing alcohol sales data, and the goal is to predict future sales trends based on historical data. The model is evaluated using performance metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

#### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Converts date columns to datetime format.
  - Handles missing values and ensures the data is properly sorted.
  
- **Time Series Visualization**:
  - Plots historical sales trends to visualize patterns in the data.

- **ARIMA Model**:
  - Implements the ARIMA model to forecast future values.
  - Provides insights into model residuals and evaluates performance using metrics.

- **Residual Analysis**:
  - Plots residuals, Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) to evaluate model performance.
